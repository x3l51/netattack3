| SCANNING |
------------

  -> Host Scan
     ---------
     It will search your network for online hosts using python-nmap. It prints out 
     MAC, IP, Hostaname and Vendor Informations for each host found.
     
  -> Advanced Host Scan
     ------------------
     It does basically the same as the Host Scan, but collects more detailed informations such as
     Operating System and Open Ports.

  -> Wifi Scan
     ---------
     This obviously scans your area for available WiFi-Networks by sniffing for beacon frames.
     The following informations will be extracted from the beacon frame: 
     ESSID, BSSID, Encryption Type, Channel, WPS and Signal Strength

-----------
| KICKING |
-----------

  -> Kick Hosts
     ----------
     This will ARP-Spoof your targets (ARP-Spoofing is explained below) but disable
     IP-Forwarding. So the packets sent by the targets won't even reach the gateway.

-----------------------
| SPOOFING / SNIFFING |
-----------------------

  -> ARP-Spoofing
     ------------
     ARP-Packets will be sent to your targets and your gateway with wrong informations.
     Your targets traffic will be redirected to you and afterwards to the gateway.

  -> DNS-Sniffing
     ------------
     It performs a simple ARP-Spoofing attack and filters out DNS-Queries.

-------------
| DEAUTHING |
-------------

  -> Deauth Access-Points
     --------------------
     Deauthentication frames will be sent to the selected Access-Points, which
     will disconnect the users wirelessly connected to the Access-Point.

  -> Deauth All Access-Points
     ------------------------
     It basically does the same as the Deauth Access-Points option, but
     it will Deauth every found Access-Point. After 120 seconds, a rescan
     will automatically happen.\n""")
